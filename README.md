# Knocking Pattern Detector
A project involving an IMU and NodeMCU ESP8266 Wifi microcontroller that detects a knocking pattern. An HTTP post request is made to a webserver, updating the count value on the database. A python script is then used to make an HTTP get request and detect if the number of knocks have changed in the database. If a change has occured, it emulates a space bar press on my laptop.
